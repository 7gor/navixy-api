# Group

### group
Tracker group is used to organize trackers in user interface. Currently, its function is purely visual.
In FSM api, groups are read-only and represent departments of the employees assigned to trackers.
Group id `0` means employee has no department, group id `-1` means tracker has no employee assigned.

## Group object structure:

```json
{
    "id": 167,
    "title": "Main office",
    "color": "FF6DDC"
}
```

* `id` - int. Group id. Used to reference group in objects and API calls. Read-only, assigned automatically by the server.
* `title` - string. User-specified group title, 1 to 60 printable characters, e.g. "Employees".
* `color` - string. Group color in web format (without #), e.g. "FF6DDC". Determines the color of tracker markers on the map.
