## group
Tracker group is used to organize trackers in user interface. Currently, its function is purely visual.

#### Group structure:

<group> = {
    "id": <int>,       // group id. used to reference group in objects and API calls. Read-only, assigned automatically by the server.
    "title": <string>, // user-specified group title, 1 to 60 printable characters, e. g. "Employees"
    "color": <string>  // group color in web format (without #), e.g. "FF6DDC". Determines the color of tracker markers on the map.
}
```

```js
{
    "id": 167,
    "title": "Main office",
    "color": "FF6DDC"
}
