#### return
```js
{
  "success": true,
  "value": {
    "id": 111,
    "type": "odometer",
    "multiplier": 1.0
  }
}
```

#### errors
*   204 (Entity not found) – if there is no tracker with such id belonging to authorized user.
*   208 (Device blocked) – if tracker exists but was blocked due to tariff restrictions or some other reason.
*   219 (Not allowed for clones of the device) – if specified tracker is a clon.

### update
